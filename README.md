   - Open the Terminal and run the following command:
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```

2. **Update Homebrew**:
   - Make sure Homebrew is up-to-date by running:
     ```bash
     brew update
     ```

3. **Install Python 3.10**:
   - Run the following command to install Python 3.10:
     ```bash
     brew install python@3.10
     ```

4. **Verify the installation**:
   - Once the installation is complete, verify it by running:
     ```bash
     python3.10 --version
     ```

### 2. **Using pyenv (Alternative)**
`pyenv` is a tool that allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Python on your system.

1. **Install `pyenv`**:
   - Run the following commands in the Terminal:
     ```bash
     brew install pyenv
     ```

2. **Install Python 3.10**:
   - After installing `pyenv`, install Python 3.10 with the following command:
     ```bash
     pyenv install 3.10.0
     ```

3. **Set Python 3.10 as the default version**:
   - If you want to make Python 3.10 the default version in your terminal, run:
     ```bash
     pyenv global 3.10.0
     ```

4. **Verify the installation**:
   - Check that Python 3.10 is installed correctly:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

### 3. **Manual Download and Installation from python.org**
If you prefer not to use a package manager, you can download Python directly from the official website.

1. **Download the installer**:
   - Go to the official Python website [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).

2. **Install Python**:
   - Open the downloaded `.pkg` file and follow the on-screen instructions.

3. **Verify the installation**:
   - Open the Terminal and run:
     ```bash
     python3 --version
     ```
